# 🎒 CampusFind — Smart Lost & Found System

> A web-based platform that helps university students and staff report, search, and reclaim lost items using AI-assisted matching and real-time notifications.

---

## Project Description

CampusFind is a **Smart Campus Lost & Found System** designed to replace the inefficient paper-based and bulletin-board approaches that most universities still rely on. Students who lose items (phones, ID cards, bags, keys, laptops) can log a report in seconds. Staff who find items can upload a photo and description. The system's AI matching engine then compares lost and found reports automatically — notifying potential matches in real time.

Once completed, the system will provide:

- A **web portal** for students and staff to submit lost/found reports with photos
- An **AI-powered matching engine** that compares descriptions and images to surface probable matches
- **Real-time email and in-app notifications** when a match is detected
- An **admin dashboard** for campus security/admin staff to manage item handover workflows
- A **statistics and audit trail** so the institution can track recovery rates
